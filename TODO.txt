To Do List
-------------

frmEmployee - newRefill tab
	stars for required fields (all, except price, which auto fills)
frmEmployee.cs - frmEmployee_Load event handler
	clear text fields (I think each tab has a button click event to clear the fields)

If unused, selectClientPrescription (stored proc) (miranda)

Better error handling - 
	frmRegister - id int only

database updates in their own try stmt

*** Low priority updates ***

add update trigger on prescription to update cost if med changes/on refill to update cost if prescid changes

whitespace/naming convention check (miranda)

hide new employee button (miranda)

hide landing form once logged in/at registration form
	I think this would require something like the employee form global variables and changing the instantiation method

clear landing text boxes when going to new client reg form

How to test/add employee logins

IMPORTANT: to test with a database, make sure you change the database name in app.config!!

On landing page, click on new client registration link
There's a temporary button for adding employee logins
enter a username and password (make sure username isnt being used in client), don't need an id.
Click on the temporary employee button -> employee login is made
Can then either add client logins or login with the employee

TESTING
**Please note what you have tested here**

Client login -> update username/password -> log back in -Miranda
employee login -> goes to employee form! -Miranda
employee login -> new client, new phys, new presc, new refill, search -Miranda
employee form (except search stuff) - general error handling -Miranda
