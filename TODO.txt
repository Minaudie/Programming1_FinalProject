To Do List
put a note with your name after the item if you did it! TY
-------------
New forms:
	Update client information (DatabaseConnections method ready)
		show client id info, but disable the text field so it cant be edited
	update prescription information (DC method ready)
		show prescription id info, but disable the text field
	update refill information (DC method ready)
		show refill id info, disable text field

frmEmployee search stuff set up (Miranda will do this)

context menu:
	on frmEmployee (search tab specifically)
		Search Prescription (when right click on client, search all prescriptions for that client) (DC method ready)
		Search Refill (when right click on client, search all refills for that client) (DC method ready)
		Edit (edit client info -> update client info form
			ON PRESC -> update presc info form
			ON REFILL -> update refill info form)
		delete (ON REFILL ONLY, delete refill info) (dc method ready)

Tab control
	frmEmployee
		new client tab
		new phys tab
		new presc tab
		new refill
		search
	frmClient
	frmLanding
	frmRegister

marking what is not optional on frmEmployee and update forms
	look at database, for columns not null

Typo corrections to do:
	DatabaseConnections - NewPrescription -> change in frmEmployee as well
	frmEmployee - addNewPrescription()

frmEmployee tab "load" 
	I (Miranda) thought that each tab had a loading event, but they're click events. These need to be removed.
	I guess each tabs load when the entire form loads, so Employee_Load should have that code instead.

If unused, delete GetRefillByID in DatabaseConnections

Login
	register new client
	check username -> employee or client
	if employee, open employee form
	if client, open client (update) form

*** Low priority updates ***

gender can only be M, F, or O, so maybe check for that before sending to DB. Addt'ly, payment can only be one of a few types.

Limit types of characters that can be entered in text fields

add update trigger on prescription to update cost if med changes/on refill to update cost if prescid changes

add @RESULT vars in stored procedures for returing success/failure

fix namespace mess (Miranda)

whitespace/naming convention check (miranda)
