*** Low priority updates ***

gender can only be M, F, or O, so maybe check for that before sending to DB. Addt'ly, payment can only be one of a few types.

Limit types of characters that can be entered in text fields

add update trigger on prescription to update cost if med changes/on refill to update cost if prescid changes

add @RESULT vars in stored procedures for returing success/failure

fix namespace mess (Miranda)

whitespace/naming convention check (miranda)
