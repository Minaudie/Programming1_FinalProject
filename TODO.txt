To Do List
-------------

frmEmployee - newRefill tab
	stars for required fields (all, except price, which auto fills)

New forms:
	reference to frmEmployee (might have done this when fixing the namespaces -miranda)

	context menu for client dgv
		edit (finished -Miranda)
	context menu for prescription dgv
		edit
	context menu for refill dgv
		edit

If unused, selectClientPrescription (stored proc) (miranda)

set icon and form titles (niko)

update forms - Mariah

Better error handling
	check text field values before sending?
	if a wrong value gets sent now it just bring the form back to landing, which is not great
	(might have to rework the client one)

//return phys/pres/refill ids after successful creation? (like client)
	dont work on this, might be adjusting the way client does it

*** Low priority updates ***

gender can only be M, F, or O, so maybe check for that before sending to DB. (niko)

Limit types of characters that can be entered in text fields

add update trigger on prescription to update cost if med changes/on refill to update cost if prescid changes

add @RESULT vars in stored procedures for returning success/failure

whitespace/naming convention check (miranda)

hide new employee button (miranda)

How to test/add employee logins

IMPORTANT: to test with a database, make sure you change the database name in app.config!!

On landing page, click on new client registration link
There's a temporary button for adding employee logins
enter a username and password (make sure username isnt being used in client), don't need an id.
Click on the temporary employee button -> employee login is made
Can then either add client logins or login with the employee

----------------
TESTING
**Please note what you have tested here**

Client login -> update username/password -> log back in -Miranda
employee login -> goes to employee form! -Miranda
employee login -> new client, new phys, new presc, new refill, search -Miranda
