New forms:
	Update client information (DatabaseConnections method ready)
		show client id info, but disable the text field so it cant be edited
		the ID gets sent to the update stored procedure
	update prescription information (DC method ready)
		show prescription id info, but disable the text field
	update refill information (DC method ready)
		show refill id info, disable text field

FIELDS TO DELETE
	frmUpdatePrescription - start date
	frmEmployee-	
		client - username deleted, change not optional to gender + dob
		presc - remove start date
		refill - remove price
	frmUpdateRefill - price, payment type
	frmUpdateClient - username, insurance, change not optional to gender + dob

frmEmployee search stuff set up (Miranda will do this)

frmEmployee new client tab - insurance drop down
	get company name from db?

context menu:
	on frmEmployee (search tab specifically)
		Search Prescription (when right click on client, search all prescriptions for that client) (DC method ready)
		Search Refill (when right click on client, search all refills for that client) (DC method ready)
		Edit (edit client info -> update client info form
			ON PRESC -> update presc info form
			ON REFILL -> update refill info form)
		delete (ON REFILL ONLY, delete refill info) (dc method ready)

frmEmployee
	new refill - disable price text box (auto filled when prescription id entered)
		     the star thingys - placement and make red
		     payment drop down - 'CASH','CREDIT','DEBIT','CHECK'

marking what is not optional on frmEmployee and update forms
	look at database, for columns not null

frmEmployee tab "load" 
	I (Miranda) thought that each tab had a loading event, but they're click events. These need to be removed.
	I guess each tabs load when the entire form loads, so Employee_Load should have that code instead.

If unused, delete GetRefillByID in DatabaseConnections
	selectClientPrescription (stored proc)
	selectRefill (stored proc)

Login
	register new client (dc ready)
	check username -> employee or client (dc ready)
	if employee, open employee form
	if client, open client (update) form
		updateClientUserPass stored proc

set icon and form titles

*** Low priority updates ***

gender can only be M, F, or O, so maybe check for that before sending to DB. Addt'ly, payment can only be one of a few types.

Limit types of characters that can be entered in text fields

add update trigger on prescription to update cost if med changes/on refill to update cost if prescid changes

add @RESULT vars in stored procedures for returing success/failure

fix namespace mess (Miranda)

whitespace/naming convention check (miranda)
