To Do List
-------------

frmEmployee - newRefill tab
	stars for required fields (all, except price, which auto fills)
frmEmployee.cs - frmEmployee_Load event handler
	clear text fields (I think each tab has a button click event to clear the fields)

New forms:
	reference to frmEmployee (might have done this when fixing the namespaces -miranda)

	context menu for client dgv
		edit (finished -Miranda)
	context menu for prescription dgv
		edit
	context menu for refill dgv
		edit

If unused, selectClientPrescription (stored proc) (miranda)

set icon and form titles (niko)

update forms - Mariah

Better error handling - 
	Currently only on frmEmployee, tons of changes because of it though

*** Low priority updates ***

change date of birth to date time picker
	lots to change in the backend as well, don't miss that if you do this update

gender can only be M, F, or O, so maybe check for that before sending to DB. -I ended up doing this as part of error handling, Miranda

Limit types of characters that can be entered in text fields
	-sort of did this as part of error handling?? not as robust as just not allowing the keys to even be entered

add update trigger on prescription to update cost if med changes/on refill to update cost if prescid changes

whitespace/naming convention check (miranda)

hide new employee button (miranda)

hide landing form once logged in/at registration form
	I think this would require something like the employee form global variables and changing the instantiation method

How to test/add employee logins

IMPORTANT: to test with a database, make sure you change the database name in app.config!!

On landing page, click on new client registration link
There's a temporary button for adding employee logins
enter a username and password (make sure username isnt being used in client), don't need an id.
Click on the temporary employee button -> employee login is made
Can then either add client logins or login with the employee

----------------
TESTING
**Please note what you have tested here**

Client login -> update username/password -> log back in -Miranda
employee login -> goes to employee form! -Miranda
employee login -> new client, new phys, new presc, new refill, search -Miranda
employee form (except search stuff) - general error handling -Miranda
